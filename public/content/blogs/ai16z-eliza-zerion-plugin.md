**[Eliza](https://elizaos.github.io/eliza/docs/intro/) by ai16z** is an AI agent framework for building on-chian web3 enabled agents. In this tutorial we will set up a basic Eliza agent and do some configuration of Eliza Plugins that allow our agent to read wallet and token information from various blockchains. 

With the **Eliza [Zerion](https://zerion.io/) Plugin**, for the first time Eliza agents can access real-time wallet and token data on 14 chains. The team at Recursive built the Zerion Plugin for the Eliza opensource community.

The Eliza Zerion plugin comes pre-installed when you fork the main Eliza repo. With it, you can build build trading bots, wallet analysis agents, and more.
